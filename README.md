textBits: Bits and Pieces of Code for Acquiring, Cleaning, and Working
with Text
================

This is a clearinghouse for bits and pieces of code pertaining to
gathering, cleaning, and working with text. In many cases, the code here
will have been put together to help a researcher with a specific
problem; if I think it might be more broadly useful, Iâ€™ll share it here.
And some of these items are just bits that I think are kind of cool.

## Prepping Data from Specific Sources

### Prepping News Articles from Nexis Uni (Folder: `nexisUniNews`)

The `processNexisNews` function reads PDFs of news articles downloaded
from Nexis Uni into R, domes some parsing and cleaning, and stores as a
dataframe. Source the
[`nexisFunctions.R`](https://github.com/burrowsdt/textBits/blob/main/nexisUniNews/nexisFunctions.R)
file and then run the function with the filepath to the folder with all
of your articles as an argument (see below). See the
[vignette](https://github.com/burrowsdt/textBits/blob/main/nexisUniNews/NexisUniNewsArticles.pdf)
for a quick overview.

``` r
source("nexisUniNews/nexisFunctions.R")
processNexisNews("nexisUniNews/data/")
```
